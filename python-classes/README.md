with this project:
python classes with objects
1st project : an initizialing
.............................
this task was not running the class when the file script is runned by alx checker so i was calling it using print(class name) to let the class of the function execute. Which gave me excess unwanted output
... but the right way is to use an init function in the class and document class and module first
..........

then you can try the ones below if error is still persisting
.......@ setter must be set , @property must be set and international code must be stated above[#!/usr/bin/python3]
